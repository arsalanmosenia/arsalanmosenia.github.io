I'm migrating from http://www.princeton.edu/~arsalan to https://www.arsalanmosenia.com (hosted on Github: arsalanmosenia.github.io)

The base for my website is an open source template from HTML5 UP (https://html5up.net). Further, I borrowed several nice features added by my old friend Mohammad Shahrad (https://mshahrad.github.io). Mohammad has done some interesting performace comparison between the Princeton's hosting service and Github here: https://github.com/mshahrad/mshahrad.github.io
